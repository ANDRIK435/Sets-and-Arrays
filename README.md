Sets
*It is collection of unique and unordered elements
*Even if you enter an element more than once in a set,it will be considered only once.So no duplicates are present
*Elements of sets are stored inside {}
*You cannot access elements on set

Array
*Python does not have a native "array" type as other languages do, but you can use lists as an alternative, or import an array with the array module (for homogeneous data types). For numerical operations, NumPy arrays are widely used.

Key Features of Arrays (Using Lists and NumPy):
*Ordered: Arrays maintain the order of elements.
*Mutable: Elements can be added, removed, or changed.
*Allows Duplicates: Arrays can contain duplicate elements.
*Suitable for Numerical Operations: With NumPy, arrays support element-wise operations and complex numerical functions.
